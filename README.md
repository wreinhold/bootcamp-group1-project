Death & Legislation

UNC Bootcamp Project #1

With all the health-related legislation being passed, has it had an effect on decreasing mortality?  For example, the FDA recently implemented food labeling regulations.  New York requires restaurants to list the amount of sodium in their food.  Many states build parks and recreation facilities in an effort to create a healthier lifestyle.  However, even with government devoted to creating legislation and warning the public about being healthier, has all the legislation been effective in decreasing the number of deaths caused by lifestyle choices?

Major Findings:

Our data was pulled from the following source: https://catalog.data.gov/ where we found .csv data 
files containing state deaths, legislations per state, and each states population.  After merging 
the files (focusing on the years 2010 to 2017), stratifying by the states with the most legislation and the states with the least amount of legislation, we found the following information:

	1.	The five states that passed the most legislation typically had a lower death rate 
		percentage (deaths per population) than the five state that passed the least amount of 
		health legislation.
  
	2.	Much of the legislation that passed had no significant correlation in lowering deaths in 
		each state.  In fact, some states saw an increase of deaths in certain health categories.
  
	3.	Due to the many limitations of the data, there was no significant correlation in legislation 
		and decreasing death rates. For most of the causes, the p-value was > 0.05. 
  		The only cause of death that had any significant correlation to legislation was suicide 
    	(all years had a p-value below 0.01).

At the beginning of our research, these were the questions we asked:
1.	What impact does health and nutrition legislation have on the leading 
causes of death each year?

Results: There is very little statistical significance between health and nutritional legislation and decreasing death rate between the years 2010 to 2017. This is illustrated in the graphs created for each health cause and in the calculated anova values.

2.	Does more legislation make a difference?

Due to an enormous about of limitations in the data, and based on our findings with the data 
provided, there were no signification findings to show that more legislation made any difference 
in decreasing deaths.


Charts and graphs that illustrate our findings can be found in the resource folder.
